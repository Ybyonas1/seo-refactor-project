 ## Description
 In this assigbment the student was given the task of refracting the existing code on a website, or in laymen terms, to fix all of the disfunctioning items & irregularities within this site.

 This assignment was also a great method for me to understand how to deploy & save my code onto github.

 ## Installation
Nothing new was installed, only simple tweaks to code every here & there were made.

 ## Visuals
The website visuals include:
- A group of people surrounding a desk that appear to be in a meeting:
- Colorful images of seo & social media marketing
- The footer also contains a hear as well.

Visually the website seemed to stay the same.

 ## Usage
- The usage of the website seems to stay the same as well. just simple tabs that draw your attention to the sections before describing those tabs
