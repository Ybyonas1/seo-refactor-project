 ## Description
 In this assignment the student was given the task of refracting the existing code on a website, or in laymen terms, to fix all of the disfunctioning items & irregularities within the site.

 This assignment was also a great method for me to understand how to deploy & save my code onto github.
 ### Notes:
1. Some of the code that was refracted were adding an id to line 36 on the HTML.
2. I also reduced the image sizes by almost a < 1/3.
3. Changed the title of the html to match the assignment.
4. Changed the scemantics of the html to a more natural flow of order, instead of having "div's" everywhere.

 ## Installation
Nothing new was installed, only simple tweaks to code every here & there were made.

 ## Visuals

The website visuals include:
- A group of people surrounding a desk that appear to be in a meeting.
- Colorful images of seo & social media marketing
- The footer also contains a heart as well.

Visually the website seemed to stay the same.

 ## Usage
- The usage of the website seems to stay the same as well. Just simple tabs that draw your attention to the sections that provide a detailed describing of what those tabs mean.

### I'm not really sure what more I can add to the readme, hopefully this will be a learning expereince & I'll be able to know if there needs to be more content on the readme's I create in the near future. 
Thank you.
